## Project Overview
Designed as an introduction into hardware hacking, the Glitchy can do power glitching to alter program execution and power analysis for extracting secrets from chips. 
See the [wiki](https://github.com/miswired/glitchy/wiki) for setup instructions and guides to performing the labs with the kit.
